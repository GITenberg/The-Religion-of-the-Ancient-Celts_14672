description: To summon a dead religion from its forgotten grave and to make it tell
  its story, would require an enchanter's wand. Other old faiths, of Egypt, Babylon,
  Greece, Rome, are known to us. But in their case liturgies, myths, theogonies, theologies,
  and the accessories of cult, remain to yield their report of the outward form of
  human belief and aspiration. How scanty, on the other hand, are the records of Celtic
  religion! The bygone faith of a people who have inspired the world with noble dreams
  must be constructed painfully, and often in fear and trembling, out of fragmentary
  and, in many cases.
